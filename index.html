            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to Kumasi Technical University.
                Kumasi Technical University was established in 1954 as Kumasi Technical Institute (K. T. I. ) to offer craft courses. 
                In 1963, the Institute was converted to a non-tertiary Polytechnic status under the Ghana Education Service to start offering, in addition, 
                technician diploma and sub- professional courses.
                The Polytechnic Law, 1992 (PNDC L.321) elevated the Polytechnic to a tertiary institution to provide high calibre skilled manpower with reference to manufacturing, 
                commerce, science and technology to act as a catalyst for technological development. 
                As a Polytechnic it was one of the famous, elegant and vibrant Polytechnics in Ghana.
                The Technical University Act 2016, (Act 922) converted Kumasi Polytechnic to the present Kumasi Technical University with the aim of providing higher education in engineering,
                applied arts, science technology based disciplines, technical and vocational training.
                It is a spectacularly beautiful institution, which is located at the heart of the Garden city of West Africa, 
                the capital city of the Ashanti Region of Ghana (Kumasi). 
                It has within the period of its existence become an important centre for the training not only for Ghana but also for other African countries.
